# rock-paper-scissors
This project was my first complete project using JavaScript. I have done many hours of practice exercises with JavaScript before starting this project, creating a project starting from an empty IDE was a difficult yet exiting new challenge. 

Initially I created functions that would play rock paper scissors in the console. This was easy enough, once I began to add UI, a whole new set of learning opportunities opened up. This project was the first chance I had to play around with function scope, DOM manipulation, and JavaScript events outside the guardrails of lesson exercises. I also brushed up on my CSS as it had been a while since I last used it.
